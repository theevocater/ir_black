ir_black is by far my favorite colorscheme for vim and terminals but its hard
to find all the pieces of it across the web.  I'm aggregating them here for my
own ease of use.

* tir_black (aka 256 color ir_black) is from [Jordan
  Soyke](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2777)
* ir_black originally by [Todd
  Werth](http://toddwerth.com/2008/04/30/the-last-vim-color-scheme-youll-ever-need/)
* ir_black terminal config also by [Todd
  Werth](http://toddwerth.com/2011/07/21/the-original-ir_black-for-os-x-lion/)


I've also included Todd Werth's various tweaked variations on the ir_black
theme.
